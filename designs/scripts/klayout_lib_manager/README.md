## Introduction

This setup enables KLayout to register external GDS files as libraries, making them available for reference.

## Prerequisites

- klayout 0.29.11+

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example_libs/                       # Folder containing examples for GDS libraries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs.json                           # JSON mapping of library_name ‚Üí GDS path
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ load_libs.rb                        # Ruby script to load and register the libraries
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # This documentation file
```

## üöÄ Usage

Launch KLayout in GUI mode by running the following script:

```bash
klayout -rm library_manager.rb
```

Example for json file:

```json
{
  "gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu7t5v0": "example_libs/gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu7t5v0.gds",
  "gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu9t5v0": "example_libs/gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu9t5v0.gds",
  "gf180mcu_fd_io": "example_libs/gf180mcu_fd_io.gds"
}
```

After running the script, you should see the following output in the terminal confirming successful registration of libraries from `libs.json`:

After loading, the libraries will appear in the Library palette under the names defined in `libs.json`.

You can then create a new layout and instantiate cells from these libraries by dragging them from the palette.  
This allows reuse of added cells without embedding them into your GDS design.
